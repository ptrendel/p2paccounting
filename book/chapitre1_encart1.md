We can use the following framework to ‘historize’ the evolution of the commons:

- 1)	The original commons are the natural resource commons, such as fishing grounds, irrigation systems, shared pastures, etc.; these types of commons, still prevalent in parts of the global South, face enormous stress in the capitalist systems, which tend to privatize and enclose such commons.  

- 2)	Once the enclosure movement starts in Great Britain, and the common grounds are privatized, farmers have to move to the cities for survival. The workers’ movement ushers in an important emergence of social commons, in which ‘life risk’ is mutualized in mutual-aid societies; many of these social commons will be nationalized to create social security systems.  

- 3)	October 1993 (the web and the browser) is the beginning of an exponential growth of networked knowledge commons: billions of people have access to such shared knowledge, which is also applied to cooperative production of free software and open design.  

- 4)	After the crisis of 2008, we see an exponential growth of urban commons for the reorganization of provisioning systems in the context of state and market failure, with food and energy already being self-produced by local commons-centric ecosystems.  

- 5)	Cosmo-local production occurs when collectives start moving to the production of material goods and services, whereby ‘all that is light is global and shared, and all that is heavy is redistributed and produced more locally.’
