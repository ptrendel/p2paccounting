An increased number of workers, especially in Western countries, are either forced or choose to work more ‘autonomously,’ considering work as a series of contributions or projects, but such a transition is often characterized by precarious living conditions. One of the ways to remedy this is through the creation of labour mutuals, through which workers start to mutualize their common work infrastructure, as well as to facilitate access to social security services. One of the potential solutions is the model of a post-subordinate salariat, i.e., a model through which workers retain their freedom to choose or refuse projects, yet join a co-owned cooperative in which they are formally salaried, thus benefit from social security. In such a scheme, members’ invoices are bundled to generate a regular salary upon which taxes will be paid, but in exchange for access to the services of the welfare state. Such a model is developed, for example, by the SMart cooperative (SMart.coop), which is active in nine different European countries.
