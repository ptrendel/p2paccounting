The research base of the P2P Foundation started with a re- examination of the logic of transition periods, when one social or civilisation system is replaced by another. The key focus of the P2P Foundation is observing and understanding seed forms that exemplify successor systems. We started by examining networked socialities and open-source production communities, that are developing commons-centric forms of organization.

Based on our understanding of the logics of peer production, peer governance and peer property, we focused on the optimal relationships between the commons and the market, and the question of creating ethical livelihoods by tweaking and transforming market practice to allow the emergence of a commons-centric economy.

Subsequently, we moved to public-commons cooperation and the commonification of public services, i.e. looking at how cities, regions and state could relate to the emergence of these new forms of civic collaboration.

Once a grounded understanding of these three institutional realities and their mutual relations was in place, we started focusing on the enabling conditions, centering on two main themes: the sustainability of material production (i.e., the thermodynamics of peer production), as well as new forms of human solidarity for the contributive economy in a networked age (commonfare).
